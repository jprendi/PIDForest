# PIDForest

This repository is part of my semester project that will be based on the anomaly detection algorithm pidforest (https://github.com/vatsalsharan/pidforest).


trying_pidforest_basicmat.ipynb :  is based on run_classification_sklearn_pidforest_alg.py and run_classification_pyod.py of vatsalsharan/pidforest/code. The code runs the algorithm for 1 dataset (in this case a thyroid dataset) that was also provided by vatsalsharan.
