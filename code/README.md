trying_pidforest_basicmat.ipynb :  is based on run_classification_sklearn_pidforest_alg.py and run_classification_pyod.py of vatsalsharan/pidforest/code. 
The code runs the algorithm for 1 dataset (in this case a thyroid dataset for now).

trying_pidforest_basicmat-Copy2.ipynb : this name will be updated one day. it's the slightly adapted version of trying_pidforest_basicmat.ipynb as it was used to just print out a bunch of stuff and properly understand what the code is doing! then i also added variables that properly store all of the splits of all the dimensions for all the trees we go through. we also store what dimensions are used how often to do a split on. using histograms to visualize it!

The scripts folder contains .py files of the algorithms that I am currently trying to understand on how they properly work.
