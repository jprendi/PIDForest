trying_pidforest_basicmat.ipynb :  is based on run_classification_sklearn_pidforest_alg.py and run_classification_pyod.py of vatsalsharan/pidforest/code. 
The code runs the algorithm for 1 dataset (in this case a thyroid dataset for now).

The scripts folder contains .py files of the algorithms that I am currently trying to understand on how they properly work.
